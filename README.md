# Thirteen

A time-fractured Sprig game where the future interferes with the present, and the present must endure the past.

## 🌌 Story

In the aftermath of a lost intergalactic war, humanity stood on the edge of extinction.

An alien race known as the **Vraiths** sought a substance buried on Earth — **Aethel** — capable of enabling time travel powerful enough to rewrite the history of the universe itself.

In desperation, a human scientist attempted to replicate this alien technology to prevent the war before it ever began.

Something went wrong.

The experiment shattered the space-time continuum, splitting the scientist across timelines.  
One version was thrown into the past.  
Another became trapped outside of time itself — visible only to his younger self.

What remains is a distorted dungeon where fragments of the future, frozen enemies from a forgotten war, and echoes of broken timelines collide.

You play as the present version, guided — and haunted — by the one who has already lived what you have yet to face.

## 🎮 The Experience

**Thirteen** is built around:
- interacting with a world affected by temporal instability  
- receiving guidance from a future version of yourself  
- navigating enemies and environments shaped by time glitches  

The game rewards observation, planning, and restraint rather than speed.

## 👁️ The Anomaly

At the heart of the distortion lies **Aethel** — and something else.

A shadowy entity known only as **The Glitch** guards the core of the anomaly, flickering in and out of existence as the timeline struggles to hold itself together.

Not all battles can be fought head-on.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Platform:** Sprig Console (Raspberry Pi Pico)
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Graphics:** Bitmap sprites

## 🎮 Controls

The game uses the standard Sprig console controls:

- **⬅ / ➡ / ⬆ / ⬇** — Move the player
- **A** — Primary action (attack / interact)
- **B** — Secondary action (context-based)

Controls are intentionally minimal to keep the focus on positioning, timing, and understanding the effects of time-based interactions.

## 🚧 Development Status

Since this game is mainly a passion project, there are no commitments for future expansions.
However this does not deny the possibility of the same in any way.
